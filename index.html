	<summary>Information about the Castle. </summary>
	
	<p>
		Neuschwanstein Castle was built in the mid to late 1800's by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. It is located in Hohenschwangau, German
		and was originally called Neuhohenschwangau 
	</p>
	<p>
		Here are some <a href="Pictures.html">pictures of Neuschwanstein</a>. One thing you may
		notice is that almost all the photos of the castle are from the outside. It is rare to find
		any pictures from inside the castle.
	</P>
	<p> 
		Despite seeming very old, the castle had many modern conveniences. There was flowing water, central heating and cooling, lifts, and construction was aided by steam cranes.

	<summary>Information about Ludwig</summary>
	<p>
		King Ludwig II was never able to see the completion of his dream however. He moved in 
		while the castle was still in construction and only stayed for 11 nights before passing
		away. Many parts of the outside of the castle were still being built and the castle never
		ended up being fully completed. In 1892 the castle was finished in a simplified form with
		many parts of the castle being simplified or never even built.
	</p>
	<p> 
		While it is unfortunate that the castle was never completed, if Ludwig had lived it is very unlikely that the
		castle would have been made open to the public. He intended to keep it private property, but 6 weeks after his death the 
		castle was opened to paying visitors. So, it is thanks to the death of King Ludwig II of Bavaria that we are even
		able to see the inside of this Castle.
